## RLUSD Invoice Settlement — Blockchain-Powered Payment Automation

This project provides a modern, blockchain-based solution for automated invoice management and settlement using RLUSD on the XRP Ledger.

The system is designed to streamline the payment process between businesses by linking invoice generation directly to secure, verifiable on-chain transactions. Each invoice triggers a payment flow that leverages the speed, transparency, and cost-efficiency of the XRP Ledger.

## How It Works

1.⁠ ⁠*Invoice Generation*  
Invoices are automatically created and stored in the system’s database, ready to be settled via RLUSD blockchain payments.

2.⁠ ⁠*Multisignature Payment Flow*  
Payments are processed through a multisignature wallet, requiring mutual approval from both the payer and the recipient. This approach ensures decentralized, secure confirmation of each transaction while eliminating the need for intermediaries.

3.⁠ ⁠*Transaction Confirmation and Status Update*  
Once the multisignature transaction is confirmed on the XRP Ledger, the system automatically updates the invoice status, ensuring real-time visibility and auditability of payment progress.

## Designed for the Future

The current multisignature mechanism serves as a temporary security layer while awaiting native escrow support for RLUSD on the XRP Ledger. Once escrow functionality becomes available, the system will migrate to a fully automated and trustless settlement process.
